# Detection-and-classification-of-skin-cancer-using-DL
Deep learning (DL), particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), enables automated, high-accuracy classification of skin cancer from dermatoscopic images. By leveraging datasets, DL models extract discriminative features to distinguish malignant (e.g., melanoma) from benign lesions, achieving performance comparable to dermatologists.
